# Project Introduction
Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent and significant health concerns globally, making early detection and accurate prognosis is critical for patient care. Predicting breast cancer survival plays a pivotal role in guiding treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. This project aims to apply Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to a synthetic dataset for predicting breast cancer survival.

By the end of the analysis, we hope to gain valuable insights that not only contribute to better survival prediction but also aid in understanding the key factors affecting breast cancer survival rates. This project emphasizes the importance of data-driven decisions in the healthcare field and aims to provide a meaningful impact on the fight against breast cancer.

# Data Overview:
The dataset includes a variety of features such as the patient's age at diagnosis, tumor size, number of positive axillary nodes, and the year of surgery. By analyzing these factors, we seek to uncover patterns and relationships that can help predict patient survival. Through the application of EDA, we will first explore the data, identify trends, detect any missing values or anomalies, and visualize critical features to gain insights into their impact on survival.

 - **Data Source:**
     The data used in this project is sourced from a synthetic breast cancer survival dataset from Kaggle. While this dataset is synthetic, it is 
    constructed to closely resemble real-world data and is frequently used in various studies to explore survival prediction 
    techniques.
 - **Number of Observations:**
     The dataset contains 2000 observations and 10 features
 - **Features:**
     The dataset contains a variety of features, each categorized into different data types, including categorical and numerical variables.
    Patient_ID: A unique identifier for each patient.
    Age Range: 30 to 84 (Numeric)
    Marital Status: Single, Married(Categorical)
   Year of Operation: Ranges from 1958 to 1970(Numeric)
   Positive Axillary Nodes (Lymph Nodes): Numeric
   Tumor Size: Numeric ranges from 0.5 to 5.0
   Radiation Therapy, Chemotherapy, Hormone Therapy: Categorical Values
   Survival Status: Numeric 1 (Survived), 2 (Deceased)
